# Mindfulness Policy

We entertain the idea that this planet is a living organism, a holistic system - made of many decentralised parts - that strives for balance and sustainability from chaos, in order to create symbiotic, more efficient and less intrusive forms of life.
#
**We value life over profit**
In order to live in harmony with this planet, we will always **favour**:

* **Building** on sovereign grade censorship resistant systems, offering data- and **self-sovereignty** for good actors, over centralised, censorable systems. 
* **Creating a harmonious habitat**, blending in and supporting synergies with the environment, over zero sum games.
* **Complementing**, over construing the **environment and individual**.
* **Embracing** new technologies and **fresh thought** processes, over conserving faulty systems.
* **Open source ideas** and build loyalty coalitions and teams (infosets/Holons), over proprietary code and hierarchical companies.
* **Preserving**, over extracting **resources** from the environment or individuals. Growing networks, over enterprises.
#
* **Cooperating**, over competing.
* **Love**, over fear of change.
* **Sustainability** over quick profit
* **Solutioning**, over discussing problems.
* Game B over Game A
