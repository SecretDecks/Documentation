## 04-Autonomous Creator Organisation (ACO) - Contribution-Survey

**The key approach is to capture contributions first and assess value last.** 

Why ? Because value led models typically dictate the nature of contributions e.g. a financial incentive contribution model will tend to favor immediate returns, an equal share of rewards upfront will penalize those who have contributed more than others etc.

A contribution led model either tracks or audits ACO member contributions first. Then rewards (in ADA) or recognition (in a Token) are applied to the contribution data afterwards.

## Identity

**This survey encourages ACO members to identify themselves as it provides a record of their contribution.**

However a anon ID option should be available and peer reviewed per work area.

## General Information

This provides an overall summary or context of a member, when they became involved and how many days they have worked.
This could be supplemented with a contribution vote by peers to capture the more intangible contribution a member has made. 

- [ ] Date joined ACO
- [ ] Days / Hours worked overall
- [ ] Cost of contribution (from member perspective)
- [ ] Contribution vote

## Work areas

A member can indicate the different work areas they have worked in and provide an estimate of Days / Hours worked in each area.
The areas are Engineering / Development , Marketing, Governance, Business, Creative, Product and Intangible work.
Intangible work is meant to capture contributions not covered by the scope of a work area.

## Cost calculations (to be decided)

Hours/Days worked - Costs
A variable rate may be applied depending up the cost/rate of the contributor (their hourly rate and work costs).

## Development 

Each work area will be divided into appropriate categories (e.g. Code, UX etc.) and be accompanied with an "Outputs" section where members can record what they have produced, built, documented etc.

- [ ] Code
- [ ] UX
- [ ] Test
- [ ] Support
- [ ] **Outputs** : What has been produced, built, documented etc.

## Marketing 

-  [ ] Campaign
-  [ ] Research
- [ ] **Outputs** : What has been produced, built, documented etc.

## Governance

- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Organization
- [ ] Procedures
- [ ] **Outputs** : What has been produced, built, documented etc.

## Business

- [ ] Business relationships
- [ ] Negotiation
- [ ] Networking
- [ ] **Outputs** : What has been produced, built, documented etc.

## Product

- [ ] Design
- [ ] Copy
- [ ] Planning
- [ ] **Outputs** : What has been produced, built, documented etc.

## Creative - Art

- [ ] Product Design
- [ ] Video / Film
- [ ] Artwork
- [ ] Art curation
- [ ] Artist outreach
- [ ] **Outputs** : What has been produced, built, documented etc.

## Intangible work

- [ ] Greeting new members
- [ ] Mentoring
- [ ] Social / Emotional Support
- [ ] Communicating news and ideas in Discord
- [ ] **Outputs** : What has been produced, built, documented etc.

# Peer Review

## Group

After the survey each contribution is assessed for due diligence by the appropriate work area Group - to confirm that there is agreement that the work took place etc.

## ACO

After the survey - intangibles are voted upon per member by the ACO.

# Reward and evaluation

Once the above process is completed a member may choose either to be awarded - 

- [ ] ADA per day / hour = Total *
- [ ] A recognition Token that simply records the above contribution.

*Note - A variable rate may be applied depending up the cost/rate of the contributor (their hourly rate and work costs).

Keeping it simple at this stage allow for the possibility  that a recognition token may become transferable later.
